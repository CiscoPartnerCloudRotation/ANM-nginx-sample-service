Cloud Center rotation
This is a script we developed as part of the Cisco Partner Rotation for cloud center.
It is just a simple custom service that creates a Nginx webserver on Centos 6 or 7.
You can use the serviceTool.py from
 https://github.com/datacenter/cloudcenter-content/tree/master/services 
to install the service in your cloud center install.
